# Probability-Distribution-and-Information-entropy-in-atoms-with-Z-2-10
This assignment is about the quantum functions of the atom wave-functions and electron densities for the atoms with Z=2-10. Additionally, some extra quantities have been calculated, such as information entropy. The main property that is demonstrated in this report has the form:

    S=a+b lnN

where N is the number of particles in the system and the constants a and b are relevant to the system.
The method that is applied in this report is similar to the methodology that was followed in the paper Information entropy, information distances, and Complexity in atoms.
The main calculations were performed with Python code.
