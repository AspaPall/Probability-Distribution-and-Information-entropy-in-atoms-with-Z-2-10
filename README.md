# Probability-Distribution-and-Information-entropy-in-atoms-with-Z-2-10
This assignment is about the quantum functions of the atom wave-functions and electron densities for the atoms with $\mathrm{2\leq Z\leq 10}$. Additionally, some extra quantities have been calculated, such as information entropy. The main property that is demonstrated in this report has the form:
\begin{equation}
    S=a+b lnN
\end{equation}
where N is the number of particles in the system and the constants a and b are relevant to the system.\par
The method that is applied in this report is similar to the methodology that was followed in the paper \href{https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/123/17/174111/917421/Information-entropy-information-distances-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext}{Information entropy, information distances, and Complexity in atoms}.
The main calculations were performed with Python code.
